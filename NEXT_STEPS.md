# Next Steps

Below are some ideas for improving the BlackFeather project:

- Expand test coverage to include CampaignManager and WorldMemoryManager.
- Move Streamlit UI components into smaller modules for easier maintenance.
- Add configuration options for the chat model and system prompts.
- Document how to deploy the app to common hosting platforms.

Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
